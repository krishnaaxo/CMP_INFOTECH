destination, and duration of flights various occasions such as vacations or festive
season. Therefore, having some basic idea of the flight fares before planning the trip will
surely help many people save money and time.
The main goal is to predict the fares of the flights based on different factors available in
the provided dataset.


## Approach: 
The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms that’s best fit for the above case.
